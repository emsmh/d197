How was the merge conflict resolved for part E1?

The merge conflict was resolved by editing the readme file to remove extra lines that were causing the conflict.
Once those were removed, the merge completed.

3 Changes made for part C1:
about.html : added name under the first p tag since it is an introduction page.
contact.html : added hours so people knew when they would expect a response.
team.html : added hard working and ready to help to describe the team.
